<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of political backlash.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Speaking before a rally today across the street from the White House in Washington, Gobadi claimed that while Iran has reported 36,000 dead, he has received estimates closer to 100,000.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The government is unable to properly assist earthquake victims, he said, because it "has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home".</a>
