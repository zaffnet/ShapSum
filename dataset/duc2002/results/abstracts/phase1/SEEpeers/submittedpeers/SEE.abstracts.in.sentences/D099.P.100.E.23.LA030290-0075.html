<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a "happening," which it surely is; or a world-class athletic event, which it may become but is not now. Look at it more as a moving advertising opportunity, human billboards running 26.2 miles through the city on live television . Massive marketing campaigns and major sponsors lining up for a seat on the money wagon do not make L. A. an elite race, give it prestige or attract the world's best runners .</a>
