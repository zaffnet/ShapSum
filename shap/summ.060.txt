The earthquake that struck northern Iran on Thursday killing about 25,000 people   registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.
Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a   ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily and the quake occurred just after   midnight, so most people were inside asleep when it hit.
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic   Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's   massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of  political backlash.
It occurred in an area of Iran   where most of the buildings are on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts and   allows structures to collapse.
The quake of 7.7 magnitude was the largest ever   recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.
The Iranian community of Orange County, California launched an effort Sunday to   collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for   hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless victims of the earthquake in   northwestern Iran.
