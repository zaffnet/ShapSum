SENATE QUESTIONING OF THOMAS ENDS   BUSH NOMINEE APPEARS HEADED FOR HIGH COURT Clarence Thomas completed five   grueling days of Senate questioning Monday, apparently well on his way to   becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.
Several committee members said they   expected the committee to recommend, by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote, that the Senate   confirm Thomas.
Although Thomas appeared to back   away from comments made in past speeches or articles, he told the committee, "My   view is that I have been consistent.
"; Thomas' opponents believe Republicans   Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Charles Grassley of Iowa,   Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.
But they hope Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
, and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,   will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and Biden, Leahy, Simon and Kohl   in voting against the nominee.
They accused him of being evasive   and of disavowing many controversial statements he made while an official of the   Reagan and Bush administrations.
They see a woman with strong   opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court.
Some women's-rights activists are   upset by her lobbying against such issues as comparable-worth legislation.
Some religious-rights groups are   troubled by her anti-cult activities in light of her former involvement with   Lifespring, a motivational group.
The fact that she is white has drawn   criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence that Clarence Thomas   has rejected his roots.
True equality is achieved by holding   everyone to the same standard, they believe.
Clarence Thomas advocates a   colorblind society, and his marriage may be an example of that philosophy.
While the 14-member Senate Judiciary   Committee presses Clarence Thomas to explain his qualifications for the Supreme   Court, all 100 senators are under mounting pressure to explain their views of   the judge.
