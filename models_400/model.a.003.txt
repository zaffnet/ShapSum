THE BAY AREA QUAKE; In the aftermath of the California   earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-  related activity yesterday morning.
Some of it was necessary to get   federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an   image of a White House in action.
Gov.
George Deukmejian is right to call   the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the   effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.
With Congress already moving to grant   up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials   are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction   aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is practical.
Deukmejian should be commended, as   well, for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to   earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape .
The state learns more from every   earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from Tuesday,   Oct. 17 .
But it is also the time to concentrate   on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience --   the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary   details of restoring their life to some kind of normality.
In the Bay Area, that includes   hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage, but face   massive obstacles in getting to work .
Roads and bridges in the Bay area   appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.
The organization estimated residential   damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in the Bay area, with between   $100 million to $150 million insured.
He is estimating this week's disaster   will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4   billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo .
